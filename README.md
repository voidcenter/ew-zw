# ethwaterloo - ZK-Werewolf

This project is a preliminary proof of concept for a fully on-chain mafia game, born from the ETH Waterloo hackathon. Development is ongoing, so keep an eye out for our updates!

The current implementation leverages Multi-party Computation (MPC) and Zero-knowledge Proof (ZKP) to achieve both privacy and computational integrity.
